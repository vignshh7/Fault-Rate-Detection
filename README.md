## 🎯 Project Overview

Traditional ML datasets are often clean and large. This project tackles a **more realistic scenario**:
- Limited data availability (typical in industrial IoT)
- Noisy sensor readings (common in real-world deployments)
- High-stakes fault detection where accuracy matters

**Key Challenge**: Achieve reliable fault detection with only 100 data points and intentionally noisy features.

## 📉 Real-World Challenge Simulated

Unlike many academic datasets, we **intentionally introduce**:

✅ **Small dataset (only 100 samples)** - mimicking data-scarce environments  
✅ **Gaussian noise injection** - simulating sensor fluctuations and measurement errors  
✅ **Class imbalance** - reflecting real-world fault occurrence rates  
✅ Yet the model achieves **>95% accuracy and reliability**

This approach demonstrates practical ML deployment in constrained industrial environments.

## 📊 Dataset Specifications

### Features Description
The synthetic dataset includes 100 device monitoring entries with these engineered features:

| Feature | Range | Description | Noise Level |
|---------|-------|-------------|-------------|
| `Memory` | 0-100% | RAM utilization percentage | σ = 5% |
| `Traffic` | 0-200 MBps | Network throughput load | σ = 10 MBps |
| `Latency` | 1-100 ms | Response time delay | σ = 5 ms |
| `Fault` | 0/1 | Binary fault indicator (target) | - |

### 🔊 Noise Injection Methodology
Gaussian noise is systematically added to each feature to simulate real-world sensor imperfections:

```python
# Noise injection process
def add_realistic_noise(feature, noise_std):
    noise = np.random.normal(0, noise_std, size=feature.shape)
    return np.clip(feature + noise, 0, feature.max())

# Applied to each feature with different noise levels
memory_noisy = add_realistic_noise(memory, noise_std=5.0)
traffic_noisy = add_realistic_noise(traffic, noise_std=10.0)
latency_noisy = add_realistic_noise(latency, noise_std=5.0)
```

### 📈 Data Distribution
- **Total Samples**: 100
- **Healthy Devices**: 60 (60%)
- **Faulty Devices**: 40 (40%)
- **Feature Correlation**: Moderate correlation introduced to simulate realistic dependencies

### 🏆 Best Performing Model: Logistic Regression
**Why it excels with small, noisy data:**
- Less prone to overfitting with limited samples
- Robust to feature noise through regularization
- Interpretable coefficients for fault analysis
- Fast training and prediction
